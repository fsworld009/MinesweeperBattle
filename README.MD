## Minesweeper Battle
![Minesweeper Battle](screenshot.png?raw=true)

This game is a recreation of Minesweeper Flags game in MSN with web page and javascript. Two players against each other and whoever finds the most mines wins the game.

This project was a team project in my web programming course in college.

The game was originally developed in the time when IE6 was the mainstream (`minesweeper_IE6.html`). I have updated the code (`minesweeper.html`) to work under latest Firefox and Chrome (tested on Nov.23.2017).
